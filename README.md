## Migration Notes

This project was migrated from a TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI setup to a simpler setup using:
- Plain JSX instead of TSX
- CSS Modules instead of Tailwind
- Custom UI components instead of Shadcn UI

The visual appearance and functionality remain identical, but the codebase is now more streamlined and has fewer dependencies.
